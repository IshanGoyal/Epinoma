Objective: Use random forest classification and LASSO to determine hyper-methylation biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This approach can be further extrapolated to work on any set of methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our methodology finds a list of 9 potential biomarkers that overlap in the output of Random Forest and LASSO. These biomarkers can be further probed and analyzed using Epinoma's novel protein-based hypermethylation detection assay.
